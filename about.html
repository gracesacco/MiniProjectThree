    <h3><u><b>Project Information:</b></u>
      We were motivated to pursue this topic on mortality rates in countries throughout 1970-2010 because we found this to be a very insightful topic that speaks to the quality of life, quality of healthcare, and more within a certain country. We decided to use a heatmap, two bar charts, and a scatterplot. We chose these four ways of encoding the data because we thought that these four encoding techniques created a visualization which met the five standards of a great visualization as it was beautiful, insightful, enlightening, functional, and truthful.  We also added interactivity where pressing a certain country on the map opens up the three graphs specific to that country. We did this in order to simplify the storyline for the audience. We also added transitions on our bar charts and scatter plot in order to make sure the audience notices how these graphs vary from one country to another. Our major takeaways from this project is that quality of life and likelihood of surviving past a certain age is much worse in certain countries. Another key takeaway is that the mortality rate is not improving, as shown by the scatterplot, so there clearly needs to be more help given to and changes promoted within countries that are struggling.

    <h3><u><b>Design + Development:</b></u>
      We began with a sketch of how we wanted our visualization to look and interact. There would be one button for the year which would trigger a heatmap encoding countries. Next, when a user pressed on a country, it would trigger three graphs to show up beneath the heatmap. There would be one bar chart showing Ages vs. Mortality rate, another bar chart showing Gender vs. Mortality Rate, and a scatter plot showing Years vs. Mortality Rate. It took us a lot of time, but we stuck to our original plan so no alternatives were necessary. However, we did have plans to simplify our interactions, if necessary. We split up the work evenly among these four sections. Shahzad worked on generating the heat map, Grace worked on the Ages bar chart, Larissa worked on the scatter plot, and Junhyung worked on the Gender bar chart. We all met via Zoom in order to put the four data encodings together into one storyline. The biggest struggle, and the most time consuming portion of our project, was figuring out how to add all four of our codes together. We performed function encapsulation as recommended, but it was still difficult to format and add interactivity between these four different graphs. The most significant lesson learned from this is that it is necessary to meet as a team very frequently, even if it is for short periods of time on Zoom, in order to make sure that every team member is on the same page and to work through errors that we have in common.
